<h3> Step by Step </h3>
	<h4> Making the Pizza Dough</h4>
		<ol> 
			<li>Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved. </li> 
			<li> Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and knead the dough with your hands. The dough should be a little sticky or tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.</li>
			<li> Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and make sure its coated with the oil and cover the bowl with the dough with plastic wrap. </li>
		<ul> 
			<li>For a quick rise, place the dough in a warm place (75&deg;F to 85&deg;F) for 1&frac12; hours. </li> 
		</ul> 
			<li> Preheat the oven to 475&deg;F for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour. </li>
			<li> Remove the plastic cover from the dough. Dust your hands with flour and push the dough down so it deflates a bit, then divide the dough in half. Forming 2 round balls of dough, place each in its own bowl, cover with plastic, and let sit for 15 minutes.</li>
			<li> After 15 minutes,  take one ball of dough and flatten it with your hands on a lightly floured work surface. Starting at the center and working outwards, use your fingertips to press the dough to &frac12;-inch thick. Turn and stretch the dough until it will not stretch further.</li>
		<ul> 
			<li>If a hole appears in your dough, place the dough on a floured surface and push the dough back together to seal the hole.</li> 
		</ul> 
			<li> Brush the dough top with olive oil</li>
			<li> Repeat steps 6 and 7 with the second ball of dough.</li>
	<h4> Preparing the Toppings</h4>
		</ol>
		<ol> 
			<li> Wash basil leaves and slice cherry tomatoes in half. Note that you are not going to want to load up each pizza with a lot of toppings as the crust will end up not crisp that way. About a third a cup each of tomato sauce and cheese would be sufficient for one pizza</li>
		</ol>

	<h4> Baking the Pizza </h4>
		<ol> 
			<li>Spread dough top with tomato sauce and sprinkle with desired toppings </li>
			<li> Place pizza onto a baking pan or pizza stone and put into preheated oven.</li>
			<li> Bake pizzas one at a time, until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden for about 10 to 15 minutes. If you want, toward the end of the cooking time, you can sprinkle on a little more cheese.</li>
		</ol>
